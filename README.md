## Description
Observing the night sky is a pastime that many people enjoy every day. But for newcomers, there's a lot of information that can make it feel overwhelming at first. Astrowatch.io provides the most accurate information to help you know when the best times to observe your sky will be. You'll find the weather and cloud coverage in the 6 Day Forecast section. You can check the sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset times for a specific day in the sun and moon cycle sections. Additionally, the moon cycle section displays your current moon phase. Finally, find out whether the 7 major planets can be seen in the "Is It in Your Sky?" section. Going on vacation or a hike?
